# Get started: a tutorial
This tutorial shows you how to download the API files and try one of the available services. If you already set up your development environment, the process should take about 15 minutes.

## Step 1: Make sure you have the API files
The files are located in the [Comic-Database-Service repo](https://github.com/KusumaKrish15/Comic-Database-Service) on GitHub. The directory contains the following files:

- `comic-database-service.json`: a JSON file containing example comic books.
- `start-server.sh`: a shell script that starts JSON Server. Use this for Linux or macOS.
- `start-server.bat`: a batch file that starts JSON Server. Use this for Windows.

## Step 2: Start JSON Server
