# Comic Database Service API

This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

The Comic Database Service lets you search for a comic in the database. Use this API service to:
- Get a list of all comic books or a specific comic book by title from the database.
- Add a comic or a comic trade paperback book to the database.
- Update a comic or comic trade paperback book to the database.
- Retrieve the following details for each comic book and comic trade paperback in the database:
    - `issueNumber`: The specific issue number of the book.
    - `publisher`: The company that published the book.
    - `date`: The publication date of the book.
    - `conditionGrade`: The grade indicating the condition of the book.
    - `status`: The status of the comic book (e.g., Restored).
    - `upcCode`: The unique product code for the comic book.
    - `tradePrice`: The trade price of the comic book.
    - `currency`: The currency of the trade price.

## API reference docs

The API References show detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service. When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.
