# Comic Database Service API

This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

The Comic Database Service provides a cloud-hosted database through which you can search for your favorite comic book. You can retrieve details like characters, authors, year of publication, and so on of a specific comic book.

## Tutorials

First, do this tutorial to set up your development system for these tutorials. You only have to do this one time per development system.

* [Setting up your development system](https://github.com/KusumaKrish15/Comic-Database-Service/blob/main/docs/tutorials/dev-env.md))

After your system is ready, these tutorials show you how to perform common tasks.

- [Add a new comic to the database](https://github.com/KusumaKrish15/Comic-Database-Service/blob/main/docs/tutorials/Add_a_new_comic.md)

## API reference docs

These API References show detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.
